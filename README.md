STACK 

This project demonstrates examples of using stacks  in Python
it covers basic operations, common use cases, and best practices.
 Stacks are lists of elements where new elements are
 added at the start of the list or removed at the end of the list.
tuple are immutable

TUPLESis
Tuples are collections of ordered, immutable data structures.
In addition to accessing individual elements, you can iterate over tuples using a for loop.
This makes it easy to perform operations on each component in turn.

 QUEUES
 
  a queue is a linear data structure that
 follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle.
 This means that the least recently added item is removed first
