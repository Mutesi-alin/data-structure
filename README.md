## STACK 

This project demonstrates examples of using stacks  in Python
it covers basic operations, common use cases, and best practices.
A stack is a collection of elements that follows a last-in-first-out (LIFO) principle. In other words, the most recently added element is the first one to be removed. Elements are added to the stack at the top, and removed from the top as well. On the other hand, a tuple is an ordered collection of elements that is immutable, meaning that once it is created, its values cannot be changed. Tuples are often used to group related pieces of information.

## TUPLES

Tuples are a type of collection in Python that consists of ordered and immutable data structures. They are similar to lists, but their elements cannot be modified once defined. In addition to accessing individual elements, you can iterate over tuples using a for loop. This feature makes it easy to perform operations on each component in turn, such as applying functions or performing calculations. Since tuples are immutable, they are often used to represent fixed data, like coordinates or database records.

 ## QUEUES
 
queue is a data structure that stores a collection of elements in a linear order. It operates on a First In First Out (FIFO) basis, which means that the first element added to the queue is the first to be removed. This principle ensures that the most recently added item stays at the end of the queue, while the least recently added item is removed first.

# HANOI TOWER
 
 The Tower of Hanoi is a classic mathematical puzzle that has intrigued and fascinated mathematicians and puzzle enthusiasts for a significant amount of time. The puzzle is composed of three pegs, typically represented by rods, and a set of disks with varying sizes. These disks can be stacked on the pegs, with the largest one at the bottom and the smallest at the top. The ultimate objective of the puzzle is to transfer the complete stack of disks from one peg, known as the source peg, to another peg, known as the target peg, with the help of the third peg, known as the auxiliary peg, acting as a temporary storage.
