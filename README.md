#DATA SCIENCE

STACK 

This project demonstrates examples of using stacks  in Python
it covers basic operations, common use cases, and best practices.
 Stacks are lists of elements where new elements are
 added at the start of the list or removed at the end of the list.
tuple are immutable

TUPLES

Tuples are collections of ordered, immutable data structures.
In addition to accessing individual elements, you can iterate over tuples using a for loop.
This makes it easy to perform operations on each component in turn.

 QUEUES
 
  a queue is a linear data structure that
 follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle.
 This means that the least recently added item is removed first

 HANOI TOWER
 
 The Tower of Hanoi is a classic mathematical puzzle that has intrigued and fascinated mathematicians and puzzle enthusiasts for a significant amount of time. The puzzle is composed of three pegs, typically represented by rods, and a set of disks with varying sizes. These disks can be stacked on the pegs, with the largest one at the bottom and the smallest at the top. The ultimate objective of the puzzle is to transfer the complete stack of disks from one peg, known as the source peg, to another peg, known as the target peg, with the help of the third peg, known as the auxiliary peg, acting as a temporary storage.
