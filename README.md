##PYTHON STACK AND TUPLES EXAMPLES

This project demonstrates examples of using stacks and tuples in Python
it covers basic operations, common use cases, and best practices.
 Stacks are lists of elements where new elements are added at the start of the list or removed at the end of the list.
tuple are immutable.
In this pull request, I made several improvements related to stack and tuple.
In this work,  I added a unit test to cover push, and pop operators in the stack and merged two tuples.
